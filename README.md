# Top Unified Work Management Workspace Ecosystem

**Curated List of SaaS Products & Open-Source GitHub Projects**  
*Focused on All-in-One Workspaces, Task-Doc Integration & Self-Hosted Collaboration Hubs*  
**Last updated: October 2026**

This repository tracks notable **SaaS platforms** and **open-source projects** for **Unified Work Management Workspaces**. These tools enable teams to consolidate tasks, documents, goals, and communication into a single connected environment—reducing tool sprawl and providing the visibility needed to align execution with strategy.

**Examples** include HubSpot Workspace, Notion, Monday.com, Asana, ClickUp, Smartsheet, Airtable, Coda, Basecamp, and Microsoft 365 (the category leaders).

**Open-source emphasis**: Unified Work Management is a domain where open-source tooling is **fragmented but increasingly capable of replacing specific slices of the stack**. No single open-source project replicates the full "everything app" experience of Notion or ClickUp, but the ecosystem covers the major needs: **Huly** positions itself as an all-in-one replacement for Linear, Jira, Slack, Notion, and Motion , **Plane** serves as a Jira/Linear/Monday/ClickUp alternative for tasks and sprints , **AFFiNE** combines docs and whiteboards in a Notion/Miro hybrid , **NocoDB** and **Teable** provide Airtable-like database workspaces , and **Focalboard** offers a self-hosted Trello/Notion/Asana alternative . The critical gap: **no open-source workspace unifies tasks, docs, databases, and communication as seamlessly as Notion**—teams typically assemble 2–4 tools to cover the same surface area.

## Open-Source GitHub Projects

### All-in-One Workspace Platforms

- **[Huly](https://github.com/hcengineering/huly-selfhost)**  
  Open-source **all-in-one project management platform** positioned as a replacement for Linear, Jira, Slack, Notion, and Motion (~28k GitHub stars)  . Combines project tracking, virtual office, chat, and docs in a single self-hosted workspace. **The closest open-source attempt at a unified "everything app"** for software teams—though each module is less deep than dedicated tools.

- **[Initiative](https://github.com/beyonders-studio/initiative)**  
  Self-hosted **shared workspace for communities and small teams** (pre-1.0)  . Bundles projects and tasks (board/table/calendar views), **real-time document editing** (docs, spreadsheets, whiteboards), calendars, wikis, galleries, queues, and dashboards. Includes a **marketplace of plug-ins** fed by a signed registry, and native apps for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux. **The most comprehensive open-source attempt at unifying work artifacts** for non-enterprise groups—but pre-1.0 with API instability.

- **[Cloudillo](https://github.com/cloudillo/cloudillo)**  
  Decentralized, self-hosted **alternative to Google Workspace** (alpha, MPL-2.0)  . Plugin architecture includes Quillo (docs), Prezillo (presentations), Calcillo (spreadsheets), Taskillo (tasks), Notillo (wiki), Ideallo (whiteboard), and more. Features **CRDT-powered real-time collaboration** (Yjs), WebAuthn/passkey auth, and federation between instances. **The most ambitious open-source workspace unification**—but alpha-stage and Rust-server-dependent.

### Task & Project Management (ClickUp/Monday Alternatives)

- **[Plane](https://github.com/makeplane/plane)**  
  The most mature open-source **Jira/Linear/Monday/ClickUp alternative** (~61k GitHub stars)  . Features work items, cycles (sprints), modules, pages, and five layout views (List, Board, Spreadsheet, Gantt, Calendar). Self-hostable with Docker. **The strongest open-source option for task-centric work management**—docs exist but are less central than in Notion.

- **[Kaneo](https://github.com/usekaneo/kaneo)**  
  Fast, simple open-source project management (MIT)  . Features Board, List, Calendar, and Gantt views; subtasks, dependencies, labels, comments, and time tracking; custom columns and fields with rules; GitHub/Gitea integration; REST API, CLI, and **MCP for AI assistants**. **The cleanest lightweight alternative** for teams wanting focused task management without workspace bloat.

- **[Focalboard](https://github.com/mattermost-community/focalboard)**  
  Open-source self-hosted **Trello/Notion/Asana alternative** (~26k GitHub stars)  . Provides kanban boards, table views, and card-based task management with multi-user collaboration. **Mature and stable**—though development pace has slowed compared to Plane.

- **[Tududi](https://github.com/chrisvel/tududi)**  
  Open-source "calm" system for organizing life and work (MIT, ~3.3k GitHub stars)  . Combines tasks, projects, notes, areas, and smart workflows; self-hosted or hosted. **A lightweight, opinionated alternative** for individuals and small teams wanting simplicity over feature depth.

### Document & Knowledge Workspaces (Notion Alternatives)

- **[AFFiNE](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE)**  
  Open-source knowledge base combining **block documents and infinite canvas** (Notion + Miro style) (~74k GitHub stars)  . Supports offline use, self-hosting via Docker, and AI-assisted creation. **The strongest open-source alternative to Notion's document experience**—but lacks integrated task management at ClickUp's depth.

- **[Docmost](https://github.com/docmost/docmost)**  
  Open-source collaborative wiki and documentation software, positioned as a **Confluence/Notion alternative** (~22k GitHub stars)  . Features spaces, nested pages, real-time collaboration, and permissions. **Best for documentation-centric workspaces**—tasks and databases require separate tools.

### Database Workspaces (Airtable Alternatives)

- **[NocoDB](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb)**  
  Open-source **Airtable alternative** (~65k GitHub stars)  . Turns any SQL database into a smart spreadsheet interface with grid, kanban, calendar, and gallery views; REST API and self-hostable. **The most mature open-source database workspace**—but it is a database UI, not a full task/doc workspace.

- **[Teable](https://github.com/teableio/teable)**  
  Open-source **Airtable alternative** built on PostgreSQL (~21k GitHub stars)  . Provides a spreadsheet-database hybrid with views, formulas, and collaboration. **A newer, Postgres-native option** for teams wanting Airtable-like functionality with data ownership.

- **[APITable](https://github.com/apitable/apitable)**  
  Open-source **API-oriented low-code platform** for building collaborative apps and databases (~16k GitHub stars)  . Positioned as an Airtable alternative with API-first architecture. **Best for developer-led database apps**—heavier setup than NocoDB.

### Additional Strong Open-Source Options

- **Trestl** — Self-hosted project workspace for personal projects and small teams; features project updates with health status, weekly reviews, GitHub/Gitea connections, and Docker/Kubernetes deployment  . **Early-stage** (v0.6.0) but thoughtfully scoped for solo developers and small teams.
- **Ideon** — Self-hosted visual workspace organizing repositories, notes, and links on an infinite canvas with Git versioning; AGPLv3  . **Niche spatial approach**—not a traditional task/doc workspace, but useful for visual thinkers managing project context.
- **OpenProject** — Leading open-source project management software with Gantt charts, Agile boards, time tracking, and portfolio views (~16k GitHub stars)  . **Strong for traditional project management**—less unified workspace than Huly or Plane.

**Frameworks for building custom systems**: The choice depends on which "unified" slice matters most. For **all-in-one software team workspace**, Huly . For **task-centric project management**, Plane or Kaneo . For **document + whiteboard hybrid**, AFFiNE . For **database workspace**, NocoDB or Teable . For **community workspace with everything**, Initiative (accepting pre-1.0 risk) . No open-source project delivers **Notion's seamless integration of docs, databases, and tasks** in a single polished experience—teams typically assemble 2–3 tools to match what a single SaaS workspace provides.

## Disclaimer

- This is a **community-curated** list — not exhaustive and not an endorsement.
- Unified work management platforms handling team data must comply with applicable privacy regulations and organizational governance policies; self-hosted solutions place full responsibility for security, backups, and updates on the operator.
- **Open-source unified work management is fragmented by design**—Huly attempts the broadest unification but each module is less deep than dedicated tools ; Plane and Kaneo excel at tasks but lack Notion-level docs; AFFiNE excels at docs but lacks task depth. **No open-source workspace matches Notion or ClickUp's integration breadth** in a single polished product. Choose based on which slice your team uses most, or accept assembling multiple tools.
- Verify license terms for commercial use; Huly, Plane, AFFiNE, NocoDB, and Teable are open-source (check repositories for specific licenses); Kaneo uses MIT ; Initiative is pre-1.0 (check repository); Cloudillo uses MPL-2.0 .

**Made for team leads, operations managers, and organizations choosing their work management stack.**  
Let's make unified work management more open, but with clear eyes about the integration breadth that commercial all-in-one workspaces still hold.
